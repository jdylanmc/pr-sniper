## Unreleased

### Added

- Manage watched GitHub repositories from Settings, with canonical duplicate
  protection, stable identities, rename/enable controls and confirmed removal
  persisted across restarts. Configure global review-policy defaults and
  per-repository overrides with visible inherited sources and independent
  automatic agent-start and comment-publication gates. This configures future monitoring;
  it does not connect to GitHub or start reviews. See [#4](https://github.com/jdylanmc/pr-sniper/issues/4)
  and [#11](https://github.com/jdylanmc/pr-sniper/issues/11).
  Invalid schedules, identities and supported credential patterns are rejected
  before saving; storage errors preserve existing configuration and returning
  focus does not discard unsaved policy edits.

- Locally buildable macOS menu-bar foundation with a font-independent crosshair,
  queue/status/setup placeholders, persistent startup preference, explicit
  opt-in launch at login, and redacted host diagnostics accessible from Settings.
  Closing windows keeps the tray alive; Quit ends the host. Includes developer
  setup, storage regression coverage and a macOS build/check pipeline. This
  foundation does not yet monitor repositories or perform reviews. See [#12](https://github.com/jdylanmc/pr-sniper/issues/12).
